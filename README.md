# Fraud-in-Wine---SVM

## Code
[Wine (SVM)](https://github.com/Sharma-Amol/Fraud-in-Wine---SVM/blob/main/SVM%20Project%20Exercise%20%5BFinal%5D.ipynb)

## Context
Scenario - A distribution company that was recently a victim of fraud has completed an audit of various samples of wine through the use of chemical analysis on samples. The distribution company specializes in exporting extremely high quality, expensive wines, but was defrauded by a supplier who was attempting to pass off cheap, low quality wine as higher grade wine. The distribution company has hired me to attempt to create a machine learning model that can help detect low quality (a.k.a "fraud") wine samples. They want to know if it is even possible to detect such a difference.

This exercise and the associated dataset were provided as part of the excellent course 'Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass' by Jose Portilla on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/), which I successfully completed.
